Since Smolyak's algorithm is a finite sum of mixed differences and mixed differences are a linear combination of direct evaluations, Smolyak's algorithm itself can be written as linear combination of direct evaluations. The corresponding formula, which provides the coefficients in this linear combination, is called the combination rule.
